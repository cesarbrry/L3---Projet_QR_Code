# L3 // Projet QR Code
Creation of a new graphic communication tool

EN QUOI VA CONSISTER NOTRE PROJET ? 
The objective of this lab is to design a "graphical" communication protocol. An example of a graphical communication protocol is the QR-CODE.
Ideally, the goal of our project would be to be able to create a graphical code for any string of characters with automatic 
detection and correction of the various errors.
